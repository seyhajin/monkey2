***** Monkey2 v1.1.07 *****

Android min-sdk now 14 for android projects.

Added Scene.DestroyAllEntities.

Added new 'instance' uniformblock type for better (not great yet) instancing.

Enabled assimp FBX and BLEND loaders.

Sprites now compare with depth buffer.

Added Sprite.TextureRect:Rectf property for simple 3d sprite animation.

Fixed Texture.Flags setter.

Added simple outline drawing to Canvas, see: Canvas.OutlineMode, Canvas.OutlineColor and Canvas.OutlineWidth. See chimpmunkdebugger.monkey2 in hellochipmunk banana for demo.

Implemented point light shadows using rgba depth cube texturing for webgl compatibility. Slow, needs to do some culling.

Added ParticleSystem entity subclass. A ParticleSystem contains a ParticleBuffer and a ParticleMaterial, so you can creating multiple instances of the same ParticleBuffer with different materials. See mojo3d particles test.

Added LinearColors property to UniformBlock and Renderer. Material color properties now always in sRGB space. Changed Color.Gold etc. to compensate (they were linear colors).

Added bananas showcase files. See Help->Bananas showcase.


***** Monkey2 v1.1.06 *****

* App no longer renders when minimized/inactive.

* Added 'Internal' decl visibility to mx2cc, which means a decl is only visible to other decls within the same module.

* Namespace mojo3d now uses degrees. Namespaces monkey.math and std.geom still use radians.

* Mx2cc now tries to make docs for type extensions. No way to link to 'em yet. 

* Entity Position, Basis, Scale, Matrix etc properties are now in *world* space. Use LocalPosition, LocalBasis etc for local space versions. Ditto SetPosition, Setbasis, SetScale etc methods.

* Added subclasses for RigidBody: StaticBody, DynamicBody and KinematicBody, use these with New instead of RigidBody.


***** Monkey2 v1.1.05b *****

* Fixes a number of fairly critical GC bugs. GC is more aggressive now which has turned up a few 'lurkers'.

* Mojo 2d lighting now handles windows/devices larger than 1920,1080.

* Added 3d modules!


***** Monkey2 v1.1.05 *****

* Added std.requesters.OpenUrl support for android and ios.

* Added WIP assimp and bullet modules mainly for future use by mojo3d but its nice to have standalone versions of these.

* Added tinyfiledialog library for linux requesters, except for Proceed which uses kdialog as there's no equivalent in tfd.

* Added WIP MSVC support for faster compile times on windows. To enable, use 'MX2_USE_MSVC=1' in bin/env_windows.txt and rebuild all modules.
